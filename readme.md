# Firefly Character Gen

This project is no longer maintained, but it is the code from http://fireflycharactergen.azurewebsites.net/

It also no longer reflects my current coding style, as the last code commit was almost 2 years ago at the time of this writing.

It was built using a beta version of .Net Core, and at the time it ran on Mac and Windows. As it is, you should be able to
build using NPM. Good luck!

I am still around on github and will approve PRs against this repo, but you might as well fork your own.
